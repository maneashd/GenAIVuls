Of course!
Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of the workflow in the diagram you see above:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Source Code (developers)
Developers push or update source code (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.).

Code can have vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, hardcoded passwords).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Qualys
Qualys scans:

Server vulnerabilities â€” operating system patches, exposed ports, etc.

Container vulnerabilities â€” base image issues, open SSH ports, outdated libraries.

Qualys sends these findings to both:

GenAI App (to process and analyze)

ServiceNow (for tracking in your security dashboard)

ðŸ”¹ 3. GenAI App (Your Custom AI)
Ingests:

Server vulnerabilities from Qualys

Container vulnerabilities from Qualys

Code vulnerabilities (directly by analyzing source code)

Functions:

Maps vulnerabilities to the actual code/configuration.

Suggests automatic fixes (for Dockerfiles, base images, Kubernetes YAMLs, insecure functions in source code, etc.).

Outputs Fixes back to developers.

Also generates findings to send to ServiceNow.

ðŸ”¹ 4. ServiceNow Dashboard
Central place where everything (server, container, code vulnerabilities) is tracked:

Tickets are created for developers or DevOps teams.

Teams get alerted based on severity (High, Critical, Medium).

Managers can track the SLA for fixing vulnerabilities.

ðŸ”¹ In short:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Source Code â†’ GenAI App â†’ Fix suggestions
Qualys â†’ GenAI App + ServiceNow
GenAI App â†’ ServiceNow
Everything eventually lands in ServiceNow, so you have one pane of glass to view:

Server issues

Container issues

Code issues

And your GenAI App sits smartly in the middle, auto-suggesting fixes instead of just reporting problems.

Would you also like me to quickly list benefits and potential next features you could add later? (like auto-priority tagging or auto-PR creation!) ðŸš€
It could help you build a very strong case if you're pitching this idea internally!
