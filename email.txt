Hi Team,

I hope you're doing well.

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the security posture of our infrastructure and applications, I’d like to propose a new initiative: building an internal GenAI-powered application to assist with vulnerability detection, analysis, and remediation suggestions — integrated with our existing Qualys and ServiceNow setup.

Today, we already have a strong framework using Qualys for server and container vulnerability scanning, with findings surfaced into ServiceNow for tracking and resolution.
However, application code vulnerabilities — such as insecure coding patterns, outdated libraries, and misconfigurations — are still manually reviewed or missed during development cycles.

By introducing a custom GenAI app, we can:

Analyze source code and configuration files to detect security vulnerabilities.

Map server and container vulnerabilities from Qualys directly to associated code or image issues.

Automatically suggest remediation steps or fixes to developers and DevOps teams.

Seamlessly integrate these findings into ServiceNow, maintaining a single dashboard for all vulnerabilities.

Reduce manual effort in reviewing code and tickets, thus improving SLA compliance and speeding up resolution times.

This initiative would also allow us to enforce company-specific security policies and create a more proactive DevSecOps culture without major disruption to existing workflows.

I believe starting with a small MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — focusing on container file scanning (e.g., Dockerfiles, base image versions) and code vulnerability detection — could give us valuable insights and quick wins.
As we scale, we can extend the system to automatically prioritize vulnerabilities, tag critical issues, and even generate secure pull requests.

I am happy to share a detailed architecture diagram and a phased implementation plan if there is interest.
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!
